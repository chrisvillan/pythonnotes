---Loops---

- for [temporary variable] in [list variable]:
   - standard for loop. iterates n times where n is length of list
   - if range is specificed then it is the more common For Loop
	- for i in range (3) -> starts 0 and ends at 2 
   - use "break" to have an exit statement out of For Loop
   - use "continue" to skip to next iteration
   - CANT MODIFY temp variable inside loop where it will take a new COUNT during iteration.

- while (statement):
   - standard While Loop
   - needs exit statment

- nested for loops example
   - for TEAM in PORJECTTEAMS:
       for STUDENT in TEAM

- list comprehensions / shortcut to for loops
   - my_var = [i for i in my_list (optional if statement)]
   - ex. usernames = [word for word in words if word[0] == '@']
        - for each word that has '@' at the beginning, it's stored in usernames as a list
   - can also modify first 'i' --> [i + " please follow me!" for ....] 

- for loops in list of objects
    - if list has objects you can iterate with 2 values
    - ex. --> my_list([(a1,b1),(a2,b2),(a3,b3)])
    - for val1, val2 in my_list: 
             - val1 is a's and val2 is b's
