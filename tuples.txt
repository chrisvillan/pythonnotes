---Tuples--

- Similar to list but are IMMUTABLE - meaning values cant be changed

- created with "()" instead of "[]" --> my_tuple = ('str1',val1)

- can be called like a list --> firstelement = my_tuple[0]

- can "UNPACK" a tuple but assigning the values to variables in one line --> var1, var2 = my_tuple
   - var1 = str1
   - var2 = val1

- ONE ELEMENT tuple needs to be creating with a "trailing comma"
   - Wrong: one_element_tuple = (4)
   - () can be used to surround expression. Above just returns 4 as a number
   - Right: one_element_tuple = (4,)
   - the trailing comma allows above to return --> (4,) or one_element_tuple[0] = 4
